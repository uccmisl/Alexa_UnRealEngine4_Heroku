# MISL-SOC-20-Ethan

This work was completed as part of MISL-SOC-20 and the summer internship of Ethan Joly, a student of University of Clermont Auvergne, France [UCA](https://www.uca.fr)

## Internship programme overview
Now in its third year, the Mobile and Internet Systems Laboratory [MISL](https://www.ucc.ie/en/misl/) - Summer of Code - 2020 is a personal outreach initiative of [Dr. Jason Quinlan](https://www.ucc.ie/en/misl/people/jquinlan/) - j.quinlan@cs.ucc.ie in which students from local secondary schools and third level institutions (foreign and domestic) intern in University College Cork during the summer recess. The goal of the initiative is to provide the students with access to a research lead project, in which they enhance their programming, logistical and development skills.

## Project overview
This project aims to integrate Alexa, Heroku Server and UnrealEngine, so you can use Alexa to control aspects of your UnRealEngine game

Step by step instructions are provided to show you how to build the various components, while an example UnrealEngine game is offered to show Alexa can be used to cast spells and display inventory

## Project Structure
The project is broken into three distinct elements, with each element having its own README file

While there is no mandatory element to do first, I would advise you start with Heroku, then UnReal, and finally Alexa.  There can be overlap between them, but nothing overly complex.

Have fun :)
